# ArduinoSmartHome

Arduino Smart Home With Virtual Raspberry Pi - DHT, Relay, 9-VOLT Potentiometer, LED and DC Motor:

IoT Assignment 2: Individual Practical Project 2023

Demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF9YbMF3188

Arduino Code using C++ uploaded to the Arduino Board, then a Rasberry PI Edge Server Backend with a HTML Frontend.

The DHT Sensor triggers the DC Motor, and the LED lights can be manually activated/deactivated from the Rasberry Pi Edge Server.  
I did not have a physical Rasberry Pi Board so I used a Virtual Enviroment on my computer through Virtual Box.
